Through my artwork, I aim to transform analytical thinking into creative expression. Drawing inspiration from my extensive travels, most of my paintings are inspired by the places I have visited. As an aspiring painter, I draw inspiration from art guide books, incorporating their images and techniques into my artwork. This approach enables me to give life to my own distinct interpretation and style, despite being a novice in the field of painting.
