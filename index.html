   I am a <a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/parul.kudtarkar">Senior Bioinformatician at The University of California San Diego</a>  and a key member of the <a href="https://fnih.org/our-programs/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp/amp-common-metabolic-disorders/">The Accelerating Medicines Partnership® Program in Common Metabolic Diseases</a>  - a multi-national collaboration between academia and industry. With combined expertise in both software engineering and bioinformatics, I consider myself more of a generalist that can bridge the gap between developing bioinformatics pipelines and software tools along with conveying ideas and sharing results with diverse cross-functional teams. Having had the opportunity to work at world renowned research institutes such as <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://beckmaninstitute.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology</a> and <a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/parul.kudtarkar">UC, San Diego</a>, my experience has been well rounded and rewarding. I am continuously dedicated to pursuing groundbreaking research that has the potential to profoundly impact the lives of patients.
