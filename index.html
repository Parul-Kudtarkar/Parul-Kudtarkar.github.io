    title: "Deciphering Lung Diseases at Single Cell Resolution (March 2020 - Present)"
    excerpt: "<span style='font-size: 1.4em;'>I persistently engage in research focused on unraveling the molecular and genetic aspects associated with lung conditions. A notable accomplishment of our team is the development of the Lung Genome Browser, a tool that incorporates knowledge about respiratory cellular niches into comprehensive single-cell maps. This innovative approach enables us to examine the pathogenesis of various respiratory ailments, including the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Notably, our research has successfully identified the underlying mechanisms behind diverse symptom manifestations. At present, my ongoing investigation centers on understanding the genetic factors implicated in respiratory conditions, specifically Bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</span>"

    title: "Echinobase (January 2011 - June 2017)"
    excerpt: "<span style='font-size: 1.4em;'>I took the initiative to create Echinobase, a sophisticated software platform, and conducted comprehensive bioinformatics analyses. This endeavor aimed to investigate the influence of genetic knockout and environmental factors on gene regulation, shedding light on evolutionary patterns. The outcome of this project has yielded a vital tool for conducting research on gene regulation and evolution, effectively addressing a significant gap within various research communities.</span>"

    title: "Cloud Computing for Comparative Genomic (January 2008 - December 2010)"
    excerpt: "<span style='font-size: 1.4em;'>I revamped the reciprocal smallest-distance algorithm, enhancing its compatibility and paving the way for the creation of a groundbreaking cloud platform for comparative genomics analysis and alignment. This algorithm examines the diverse genomes to uncover genomic relationships and forecast the evolution of genes, organisms, and biological functions. Additionally, I successfully optimized the algorithm, significantly reducing computational load and cost by an impressive forty percent. This achievement marks the introduction of the first-ever comparative genomic algorithm on a cloud platform.</span>"

   I am a <a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/parul.kudtarkar">Senior Bioinformatician at The University of California San Diego</a>  and a key member of the <a href="https://fnih.org/our-programs/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp/amp-common-metabolic-disorders/">The Accelerating Medicines PartnershipÂ® Program in Common Metabolic Diseases</a>  - a multi-national collaboration between academia and industry. With combined expertise in both software engineering and bioinformatics, I consider myself more of a generalist that can bridge the gap between developing bioinformatics pipelines and software tools along with conveying ideas and sharing results with diverse cross-functional teams. Having had the opportunity to work at world renowned research institutes such as <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://beckmaninstitute.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology</a> and <a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/parul.kudtarkar">UC, San Diego</a>, my experience has been well rounded and rewarding. I am continuously dedicated to pursuing groundbreaking research that has the potential to profoundly impact the lives of patients.
