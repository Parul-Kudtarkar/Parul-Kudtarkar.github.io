   I am a <a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/parul.kudtarkar">Senior Bioinformatician at The University of California San Diego</a>  and a key member of the <a href="https://fnih.org/our-programs/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp/amp-common-metabolic-disorders/">The Accelerating Medicines PartnershipÂ® Program in Common Metabolic Diseases</a>  - a multi-national collaboration between academia and industry. With combined expertise in both software engineering and bioinformatics, I consider myself more of a generalist that can bridge the gap between developing bioinformatics pipelines and software tools along with conveying ideas and sharing results with diverse cross-functional teams. Having had the opportunity to work at world renowned research institutes such as <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a>, <a href="https://beckmaninstitute.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology</a> and <a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/parul.kudtarkar">UC, San Diego</a>, my experience has been well rounded and rewarding. I am continuously dedicated to pursuing groundbreaking research that has the potential to profoundly impact the lives of patients.

  In my personal life, I am an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/parulkudtarkar/">avid runner and a travel enthusiast</a>. During my leisure time, I engage in <a href="https://sortingmydna.com/art/">painting</a> as a creative outlet.  I have a keen interest in environmental philanthropy, specifically centered around causes like <a href="https://protect.worldwildlife.org">wildlife preservation and forest conservation</a>. I also enjoy preparing healthy and fun meals for my family and friends.
